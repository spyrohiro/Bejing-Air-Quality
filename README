This project looks at the weather recording stations data around Beijing it then uses various machine learning methods to predict PM2.5 concentrations.

it does this by classifying them into four categories:

<=35

36-75

76-150

,>151

Datasets:

The normalised data was batched and windowed, then PCA batched data was created. The regular data was then extracted to numpy data there was a 70-20-10 split of training, validation and test data.

Models:

lstm_base: the baseline lstm model

lstm_pca: a lstm model with pca

lstm_deep: a deeper model with dropout layers

rfp: a regular randomforest with default parameters

rfh: random_forest with changed hyper-paramters

lstm_final: a lstm with three performance investigations on the test data
